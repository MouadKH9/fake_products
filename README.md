## Fake products
This is a small React application that allows the user to do the following:
- View all products from https://fakestoreapi.com/products
- Filter the products by category
- Sort the data by price, rating or ID.
- Paginate the data.

### Project structure

We have two main directories:
- Pages: This would store all the pages in the app, and thei subcomponents.
- Types: We'd put all our types and interfaces by page in here.
- Components: Storing the reusables compoonents for our app, in our case we have none.
